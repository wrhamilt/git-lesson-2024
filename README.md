# Git Lesson

This lesson covers the basics of git for version control.

This lesson is for the first day of the MSSE bootcamp (Chem 280). 

To make a commit ("version" or "checkpoint") of your files, follow this procedure:

1. Make changes to your project that you would like to keep.
2. When you have your changes, tell 'git' you are ready to create a checkpoint of the file using the 'git add FILENAME' command.
3. Creat a checkpoint of your file using 'git commit -m "Message about what you did". 

## Adding Features
Features should be developed on branches.
To create and switch to a branch, use the command

'git switch -c NEW_BRANCH_NAME'

To switch to an existing branch, use

'git switch BRANCH_NAME'
